▪️ Differences between apt and aptitude ↙️
Aptitude is an enhanced version of apt. APT is a lower-level package manager and aptitude is a high-level package manager. Another big difference is the functionality offered by both tools. Aptitude offers better functionality compared to apt-get. Both are able to provide the necessary means to perform package management. However, if you are looking for a more feature-rich approach, Aptitude should be it.

A security module in the Linux kernel that allows the system administrator to restrict the capabilities of a program.
